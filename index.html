        Hello! my name is Joseph Cellini and welcome to my homepage. I hope that this serves to get <br>
        to know me better and to help you understand me! This for all intents and purposes will serve <br>
        as a blog. What is a blog, you say? A blog (a shortened version of “weblog”) is an online journal <br>
        or informational website displaying information in the reverse chronological order, with the latest <br>
        posts appearing first, at the top. It is a platform where a writer or a group of writers share <br>
        their views on an individual subject.

        As of right now, I'm trying to be a developer. Develops have the power and passion to make the world <br>
        a better place for everyone by making life easier to manage. A range of occupations that involve programming <br>
        also often require a range of other, similar skills, for example: (software) developer, web developer, <br>
        mobile applications developer, embedded firmware developer, software engineer, computer scientist, game programmer, <br>
        game developer and software analyst. The use of the term programmer as applied to these positions is sometimes <br>
        considered an insulting simplification or even derogatory.

        My hometown is Canton, Michigan! Canton Township is Michigan's second most-populated township <br>
        (after Clinton Township) and eleventh most-populated municipality overall. The township is <br>
        ranked as the 96th highest-income place in the United States with a population of 50,000 or more <br>
        and is also consistently ranked as one of the safest cities in the state and nation. <br>
        In 2015, the township was ranked as the 29th safest city in the United States.
